Here's the revised version with a more generalized tone for the template:

# WordPress Plugin Template Using PHPNomad and PHPScoper

This is a template for building WordPress plugins using **PHPNomad** for structured setup and **PHPScoper** to safely
compile and isolate dependencies. This template allows for the creation of plugins that can be used alongside other
plugins using the same libraries without causing conflicts.

## Features

- Structured development and production environments.

- Uses PHPScoper to prefix dependencies and prevent conflicts with other plugins.

- Automated setup script for easy environment configuration.

## Requirements

- Composer
- PHP 7.4 or higher

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash

git clone https://github.com/your-repository/plugin-template.git

cd plugin-template

```

### Step 2: Run the Setup Script

This template includes a `setup.sh` script to help set up the development or production environment automatically. You
can run the setup in two modes: production and development.

```bash
chmod +x ./setup.sh
./setup.sh --dev
```

### Prerequisite: Composer

Before proceeding, ensure that Composer is installed on your machine. You can install Composer by following the
instructions at [https://getcomposer.org/download/](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

### Step 3: Run the Setup

#### For Production Setup

If you're setting up the plugin for production, simply run:

```bash

./setup.sh

```

This will install dependencies using the standard `composer.json` file and prepare the plugin for production use.

#### For Development Setup

If you're setting up the plugin for development, run:

```bash

./setup.sh --dev

```

This will swap the `composer.json` file with `composer-dev.json`, install development dependencies, and prepare the
environment for development purposes.

### Step 4: Activate the Plugin

Once the setup is complete, activate the plugin through the WordPress admin dashboard:

1\. Navigate to **Plugins** > **Installed Plugins**.

2\. Find your plugin in the list and click **Activate**.

Alternatively, you can activate the plugin via WP-CLI:

```bash

wp plugin activate your-plugin-name

```

## Files Overview

### Plugin Files

- `plugin.php`: The main plugin file. This is where the plugin is bootstrapped and initialized.

- `composer.json`: The standard Composer file for production.

- `composer-dev.json`: The development Composer file for setting up the dev environment.

- `scoper.inc`: Configuration file for PHPScoper that prefixes dependencies.

- `setup.sh`: A script to automate the setup process for production and development environments.

### Composer Files

The template uses two different Composer files:

- **composer.json**: For production environment, contains necessary dependencies.

- **composer-dev.json**: For development environment, includes extra dependencies for debugging, testing, and
  development.

### scoper.inc

This file configures PHPScoper to prefix dependencies with a custom namespace to avoid conflicts with other plugins that
may use the same libraries.

## Development Notes

If you are developing a plugin using this template, always use the development setup by running:

```bash

./setup.sh --dev

```

This will set up your environment to use `composer-dev.json` and install the necessary dependencies.
